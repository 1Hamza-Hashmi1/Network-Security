Public-key scheme is used to distribute a master key KA (a symmetric key shared
key by KDC and client A) and a master key KB (a symmetric key shared by KDC
and client B). Both KA and KB are generated by KD


notes:
-when run kdc, it generates public and private key of A and B (RSA Key Pair - PUB & PRA) and also generates Master Keys KA and KB
-when A connects to KDC, KDC sends KA encrypted in A public key
-A decrypts msg uring her own private key which she already has

-then when B connects to KDC, KDC sends KB encrypted in B public key
-B decrypts msg uring his own private key which he already has

Note: in phase 1 its only about KDC securely distributing master keys
